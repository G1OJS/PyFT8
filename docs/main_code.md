# Overview of main code
[To be written]

The code itself is light on explanation, but I've avoided anonymous variable names like 'n5_b' as much as possible in favour of varable names that tell the story. Also, whilst I've used AI to introduce me to coding best practice and DSP techniques, I don't let their bloat survive the cut. This has
been productive - constantly badgering AI has resulted in a very compact and very fast LDPC decoder which has increased in speed
by about 2 orders of magnitude since I first hand-translated some FORTRAN into Python.
