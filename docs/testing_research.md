### Test scripts
Below are some screenshots from test programs that can be used to look at how the protocols actually work, illustrated with a fairly
ordinary waterfall and some zoomed-in depictions of captured signals with an overlay of the syncrhonisation tones that are used
to search for the signals (Costas patterns). To try these scripts, download the Python from this repository (clone, download raw etc)
and run in your chosen environment. These images probably need updating so don't expect exact copies, but they give the idea.
